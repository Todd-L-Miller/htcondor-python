ClassAds Introduction
=======================================

In this module, you will learn the basics of the `ClassAd language <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/classad/classad.html>`_,
the policy and data exchange language that underpins all of HTCondor.  Before we start to interact with the HTCondor daemons,
it is best to learn ClassADs.

As always, we start off by importing the relevant module::

   import classad
   
Great!

The python bindings - and HTCondor itself - are strongly centered on the ClassAd language.

The ClassAd language is built around *values* and *expressions*.  If you know Python, both concepts are familiar.
Examples of familiar values include:

* Integers (``1``, ``2``, ``3``),
* Floating point numbers (``3.145``, ``-1e-6``)
* Booleans (``true`` and ``false``).
* Strings (``"Hello World!"``).

Examples of expressions are:

* Attribute references: ``foo``
* Boolean expressions: ``a && b``
* Arithmetic expressions: ``123 + c``
* Function calls: ``ifThenElse(foo == 123, 3.14, 5.2)``

Expressions can be evaluated to values.  Unlike many programming languages, expressions are lazily-evaluated:
they are kept in memory until a value is explicitly requested.

The python bindings interact with the ClassAd language through the `ExprTree` and `ClassAd` objects.  Let's first 
examine simple expressions::

   >>> arith_expr = classad.ExprTree("1 + 4")
   >>> print "ClassAd arithemetic expression: %s (of type %s)" % (arith_expr, type(arith_expr))
   ClassAd arithemetic expression: 1 + 4 (of type <class 'classad.ExprTree'>)
   >>> print arith_expr.eval()
   5
   >>> function_expr = classad.ExprTree("ifThenElse(4 > 6, 123, 456)")
   >>> print "Function expression: %s" % function_expr
   Function expression: ifThenElse(4 > 6,123,456)
   >>> value = function_expr.eval()
   >>> print "Corresponding value: %s (of type %s)" % (value, type(value))
   Corresponding value: 456 (of type <type 'long'>)

Notice that, when possible, we convert ClassAd values to Python values.  Hence, the result of
evaluating the expression above is the python number ``456``.

There are two important values in the ClassAd language that have no direct equivalent in
Python: ``Undefined`` and ``Error``.

``Undefined`` occurs when a reference occurs to an attribute that is not defined; it is
analogous to a ``NameError`` exception in Python (but there is no concept of an exception
in ClassAds).  ``Error`` occurs primarily when an expression combines two different types
or when a function call occurs with the incorrect arguments.::

   >>> print classad.ExprTree("foo").eval()
   Undefined
   >>> print classad.ExprTree('5 + "bar"').eval()
   Error
   >>> print classad.ExprTree('ifThenElse(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)').eval()
   Error

**So what?**

Expressions, values, and various error conditions are not particularly inspiring or new.

The concept that makes the ClassAd language special is, of course, the *ClassAd*!

The ClassAd is analogous to a python or JSON dictionary.  *Unlike* a dictionary, which is a
set of unique key-value pairs, the ClassAd object is a set of key-*expression* pairs.
The expressions in the ad can contain attribute references to other keys in the ad.

There are two common ways to represent ClassAds.  The "new ClassAd" format::

   [a = 1;
    b = "foo";
    c = b
   ]

And the "old ClassAd" format::

   a = 1
   b = "foo"
   c = b

Despite the "new" and "old" monikers, "new" is over a decade old and HTCondor command line
tools utilize the "old" representation; the python bindings default to "new".

A :class:`~classad.ClassAd` object may be initialized via a string using one of the above
representation.  As a ClassAd is so similar to a python dictionary, they may be constructed
from a dictionary.

Let's construct some ClassAds!::

   >>> ad1 = classad.ClassAd("""[
   ...    a = 1;
   ...    b = "foo";
   ...    c = b;
   ...    d = a + 4;
   ... ]""")
   >>> print ad1
   
       [
           a = 1; 
           b = "foo"; 
           c = b; 
           d = a + 4
       ]

ClassAds are quite similar to dictionaries; in python, the :class:`~classad.ClassAd`
object behaves similarly to a dictionary and has similar convenience methods::

   >>> print ad1["a"]
   1
   >>> print ad1["not_here"]
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   KeyError: 'not_here'
   >>> print ad1.get("not_here", 5)
   5
   >>> ad1.update({"e": 8, "f": True})
   >>> for key in ad1:
   ...    print key, ad1[key]
   f True
   e 8
   a 1
   b foo
   c b
   d a + 4

Remember our example of an ``Undefined`` attribute above?  We now can evaluate references within the ad::

   >>> print ad1.eval("d")
   5

Note that an expression is still not evaluated until requested, even if it is invalid:::

   >>> ad1["g"] = classad.ExprTree("b + 5")
   >>> print ad1["g"], type(ad1["g"])
   b + 5 <class 'classad.ExprTree'>
   >>> print ad1.eval("g")
   Error

ClassAds and expressions are core concepts in interacting with HTCondor.  Internally,
machines and jobs are represented as ClassAds; expressions are used to filter objects and to define policy.

There's much more to learn in ClassAds!  We maintain comprehensive module documentation for :mod:`classad`.

For now, you have enough background to continue to the next tutorial.
