HTCondor Python Documentation
=============================

This repository represents an _experimental_ effort to modernize the documentation
for the HTCondor python bindings.  There are two broad tracks this effort is taking:

- Self-guided live tutorials using JupyterHub.  JupyterHub allows a Docker container
  to be spawned per logged-in users.  We additionally launch a small HTCondor instance
  to be used from within the Jupyter notebook.
- Reformatting of the python documentation to reStructuredText, use sphinx, and be hosted
  by ReadTheDocs.
